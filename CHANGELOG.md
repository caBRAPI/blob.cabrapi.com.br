## [2026-06-29]

### Added
- Added `view_count` tracking for inline file views (`/blob/:id/view`).

### Changed
- Updated file serving flow to use explicit counters per route:
	- `/blob/:id/download` increments `download_count`
	- `/blob/:id/view` increments `view_count`
- Metrics summary now includes `total_views`.
- Updated API documentation examples and schema with `view_count`.

### Fixed
- Added legacy-safe counter increment using `COALESCE(..., 0) + 1`.
- Added startup backfill to normalize `NULL` values in `download_count` and `view_count` to `0`.
